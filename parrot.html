               In the types of pet birds, a parrot is one. The scientific name of the parrot is Psittaciformes.
They belong to a family of Psittacopasserae. These are mostly found in subtropical and tropical regions. There 
are about 372 species in existence in 86 general. Their size ranges from 3.5 to 40 inches and a mass of about 
2.25 to 56 ounces. These birds live in groups called flocks, and each congregation contains about 20-30 birds.
They are omnivores, meaning; they eat nuts, fruit, and insects, etc. The clutches of parrot contain only two 
eggs, and the incubation period is about 18-30 days. A newborn parrot is blind for the first two weeks. A chick 
becomes fully mature only by 1- 4 years, depending on species. The lifespan of a parrot varies from 50- 95 years.
The most important components of most parrots' diets are seeds, fruits like nuts, buds and other plant material.
A few species sometimes eat animals and carrion (dead animal carcasses), while the lories and lorikeets are specialised 
for feeding on floral nectar and soft fruits. Almost all parrots nest in tree hollows, and lay white eggs from which hatch
altricial (helpless) young. Parrots are among the most intelligent birds, as are the crow family: ravens, crows, jays and
magpies, and the ability of some species to make sounds like human voices enhances their popularity as pets.
in the genomes of passerines and parrots are similar, but those in the genomes of other birds are not. This is strong evidence 
that parrots are the sister group of passerines.[10] Europe is the origin of the first presumed parrot fossils, which date from
about 50 million years ago (mya).[11] The climate there and then was tropical. Several fairly complete skeletons of parrot-like 
birds have been found in England and Germany.[12] On the whole it seems likely that these are not direct ancestors of the modern
parrots, but related lineages which evolved in the northern hemisphere, and which have since died out.
The earliest records of modern parrots date to about 23–20 mya and are also from Europe. Subsequently, the fossil record—again mainly
from Europe—consists of bones clearly recognisable as belonging to parrots of modern type. The southern hemisphere does not have nearly 
as rich a fossil record for this period as the northern, and contains no known parrot-like remains earlier than the early to middle Miocene,
around 20 mya. The first unambiguous parrot fossil (as opposed to a parrot-like one) is found in the Miocene. It is an upper jaw, identical
 that of modern cockatoos.
