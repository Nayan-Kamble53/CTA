            <td><b>A sparrow is a member of the genus Passer. They are small passerine birds which belong to the family Passeridae. They are also
            known as old-world sparrows. Sparrows often make their nests near houses or buildings. This means they are one of the easiest birds
            to see in the wild.The genus has about 30 species around the world. The best known of these is the house sparrow, Passer domesticus.
            Some authorities place other genera in the sparrow group: Petronia, the rock sparrows; Carpospiza, the pale rockfinch; and Montifringilla,
            the snowfinches.The house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is a species of sparrow. It lives all over the world. It originally lived only
            in Europe and Asia. However, people travelled to new places and the house sparrow went to those places too. It is now the bird with
            the widest distribution. This means it lives in the most places. The species has about 50 subspecies.
            Sparrows can be seen on every continent on earth. A long time ago, they lived only in Europe, Asia and Africa. However, people traveled
            to Australia, North America and South America, and now sparrows are seen there too. The house sparrow is seen in every continent. In
            Australia, there are no sparrows in Western Australia, as they have not been able to travel across the deserts that separate that state
            from the eastern states.[2] The government employs people to hunt and destroy any sparrows that might arrive.
            The house sparrow lives close to humans, often near human houses in towns or cities. It also lives near farms and makes a nest in a
            bush or small tree. It can have two or three broods per year. This means it has two or three sets of eggs and chicks each year.Nest
            sites are varied, though cavities are preferred. Nests are most frequently built in the eaves and other crevices of houses. Holes 
            in cliffs and banks, or tree hollows, are also used.[6]p52–57 A sparrow sometimes digs out its own nests in sandy banks or rotten 
            branches. More often it uses the nests of other birds, such swallows' nests in banks and cliffs, and old tree nest holes. It often 
            uses deserted nests. Sometimes it takes over active nests by driving away or killing the occupants.[6][7] Tree hollows are more commonly
            used in North America than in Europe.[8] This puts the sparrows in competition with bluebirds and other North American cavity nesters so
            the native bird population declines.
