            <td> <b>Kingfisher belongs to a family of Alcedinidae and has three other families like Alcedinidae,
                Halcyonidae, and Cerylidae. This beautiful bird belongs to the families that contain rivers, 
                trees, and water kingfishers. There are about 90 species in kingfishers.  Kingfisher has a large
                head, sharp, long, and pointed bills with short legs and stubby tails. Most of the species have
                plumage with differences in their sexes. These are mostly found in forests in tropical regions.
                They generally feed on fish and a wide range of prey. They love to live near rivers to eat fish.
                Their nest will be in cavities; tunnels dug into artificial banks in the ground. A quarter of kingfishers
                lives in unused termite nests.
                Distribution and habitat: The kingfishers have a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring throughout the world's tropical and 
                temperate regions. They are absent from the polar regions and some of the world's driest deserts. A number of species have reached
                islands groups, particularly those in the south and east Pacific Ocean. The Old World tropics and Australasia are the core areas
                for this group. Europe and North America north of Mexico are very poorly represented, with only one common kingfisher (common kingfisher
                and belted kingfisher, respectively), and a couple of uncommon or very local species each: (ringed kingfisher and green kingfisher in the 
                southwestern United States, pied kingfisher and white-throated kingfisher in southeastern Europe). The six species occurring in the Americas
                are four closely related green kingfishers in the genus Chloroceryle and two large crested kingfishers in the genus Megaceryle. Even tropical
                South America has only five species plus the wintering belted kingfisher. In comparison, the African country of the Gambia has eight resident
                species in its 120-by-20-mile (193 by 32 km) area. Individual species may have massive ranges, like the common kingfisher, which
                ranges from Ireland across Europe, North Africa, and Asia as far as the Solomon Islands in Australasia, or the pied kingfisher,
                which has a widespread distribution across Africa and Asia. Other species have much smaller ranges, particularly insular species
                which are endemic to single small islands. The Kofiau paradise kingfisher is restricted to the island of Kofiau off New Guinea.
                Kingfishers occupy a wide range of habitats. While they are often associated with rivers and lakes, over half the world's species
                are found in forests and forested streams. They also occupy a wide range of other habitats. The red-backed kingfisher of Australia
                lives in the driest deserts, although kingfishers are absent from other dry deserts like the Sahara. Other species live high in 
                mountains, or in open woodland, and a number of species live on tropical coral atolls. Numerous species have adapted to human-modified 
                habitats, particularly those adapted to woodlands, and may be found in cultivated and agricultural areas, as well as parks and gardens
                in towns and cities
